## 🚀 Project Overview

Most teams spend hours every week pulling data, analyzing trends, and preparing summaries.  
This project demonstrates an **agentic AI workflow** that automates the entire insights lifecycle:

- Pulls data from a source (CSV, BigQuery, API)  
- Processes it using Python  
- Sends a prompt to an LLM for insight generation  
- Automatically sends the summary to Slack or Email  
- Runs on a schedule via **n8n**  

This is a real-world example of **AI + automation + analytics engineering**, ideal for enterprise productivity and transformation.
